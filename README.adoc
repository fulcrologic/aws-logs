== AWS Log Helpers

There is a general CLI called `saw` that works reasonably well, but I needed something that
was easier to tune. The AWS API is pretty easy to work with, so having something in
Clojure that can be used to deal with logging concerns is nice.

== Usage

Add an alias to your Deps
[source, clojure]
-----
 :aliases {:watch {:extra-deps {com.fulcrologic/aws-logs "2021"}
                   :replace-deps {com.fulcrologic/aws-logs {:mvn/version "2.0.206"}}
                   :exec-fn   com.fulcrologic.aws-logs.log-access/watch
                   :exec-args {:log-group    "datomic-dataico"
                               :strip-prefix "dataico-dataico"}}}}
